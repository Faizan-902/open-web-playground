# Contributing to This Project 💡

## 🪄 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Click the **Fork** button (top-right corner of this repository page) to create your copy.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <repository-name>
   ```
4. Add the main repository as a remote to keep your fork updated:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<original-owner>/<repository-name>.git
   ```

## 🌿 2. Create a New Branch

Before making changes, create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

👉 **Example:**

```bash
git checkout -b fix-readme-typo
```

Keep branches short and meaningful — one branch per feature or fix.

## 💻 3. Coding Standards and Best Practices

Follow these simple rules to keep the code clean and consistent:

* ✅ Use **clear variable and function names** (e.g., `getUserData` not `gud`).
* ✅ Follow **consistent indentation** (4 spaces or per project’s style).
* ✅ Write **comments** for complex logic.
* ✅ Run tests (if available) before submitting a pull request.
* ✅ Keep commits **small and meaningful** — use descriptive commit messages like:

  ```
  fix: corrected typo in README
  feat: added login form validation
  ```

## 🚀 4. Submitting a Pull Request (PR)

1. Commit your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your change briefly"
   ```
2. Push your branch:

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```
3. Go to your **forked repo on GitHub**, and you’ll see a “Compare & pull request” button.
4. Click it and open a new pull request (PR).

👉 **Tips for a great PR:**

* Explain what you changed and why.
* Mention related issue numbers (if any), e.g. `Fixes #12`.
* Request review from maintainers.
